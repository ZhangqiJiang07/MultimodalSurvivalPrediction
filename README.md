# Pancancer survival prediction using a deep learning architecture with multimodal representation and integration


## Data
Please download the data from our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1siaUPxmZQ3v2VBRCNCnFZxRBB3Wh-j4f/view?usp=sharing). Make sure the unzipped data folder is in the 'MultimodalSurvivalPrediction' directory before you start running experiments.

## Experiments
If youâ€™d like to run experiment with specified modality combination (e.g. only clinical and miRNA) use the `Clinical_xx_main.py` files.

To run the experiment of your choice, simply type:
```
>> cd <Path_to_MultimodalSurvivalPrediction_folder>
>> python3 Clinical_xx_main.py
```
